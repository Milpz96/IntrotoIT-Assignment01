<button onclick="IdealJob.html'">HTML Tutorial</button>
<p>
My interest in IT started when I was in high school and I wanted to learn how to make a game. I chose RMIT due to the reputation of being the best in the industry. I expect to learn the ins and out of the world of IT and find a career path for the future.
