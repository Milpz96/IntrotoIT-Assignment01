The first test I did was the 16-personality test, the test result came back saying I am the ADVOCATE type. This result means that I am a person who is willing to help people and have a creating mind,<br> this helps with group activities because Iâ€™m a person people can rely on with support. Fitting in a group dynamic as a advocate helps the diversity of the group and helps the project moving forward.

The second test I did was the Learning style test, the test results came back saying I am a Visual/Tactile learner. I learn by getting hands on with whatever I am doing at the time,<br> in a group situation if someone was to show me how to process something for them, ill questions and make sure I have it 100% down before jumping in a doing it, asking questions when needed. Having someone like me in a group will help take some pressure off the team once I have learned it.

The third test I completed was the 123-test, this one is on the Big Five personality. The biggest take I took from this test was a 74% on Extraversion and that lines up with me being a person who is out going and super friendly,<br> it also shows that I love working with people and having that asset with group work makes me desirable to work with.
