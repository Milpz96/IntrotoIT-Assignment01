<h3> About me: </h3> 

<p> Hello, my name is Miller Blair. 
My student No. is S3866656.
My email address is s3866656@student.rmit.edu.au
I love to listen to music, it depends on my mood, it will be heavy metal to rap and everything between that. 
I played a lot of AFL growing up but now I much prefer to an armchair coach in front of the tv or at a game. 
I have a strange background, I am a mix of British, Scottish, Italian, German, Malaysian, so a nice mix from around the globe. 
</p>
<p>
I have a cute cat; his name is Poe named after the Statue “The Thinker”, It was going to be called “The Poet” originally. 
He would sit back and wait for the time to strike when his brothers would be play fighting and this is how his name was thought of.
