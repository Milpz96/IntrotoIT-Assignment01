<h2> About me: </h2> 

  <p> Hello, my name is Miller Blair.</p> 
 <p> My student No. is S3866656.</p>
  <p>My email address is s3866656@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
I love to listen to music, it depends on my mood, it will be heavy metal to rap and everything between that.<br> 
I played a lot of AFL growing up but now I much prefer to an armchair coach in front of the tv or at a game. <br>
I have a strange background, I am a mix of British, Scottish, Italian, German, Malaysian, so a nice mix from around the globe. 
</p>
<p>
I have a cute cat; his name is Poe named after the Statue “The Thinker”, It was going to be called “The Poet” originally. <br>
He would sit back and wait for the time to strike when his brothers would be play fighting and this is how his name was thought of.
