<h4>Overview</h4>
A Positive Walk will be an app that can assist people with anxiety, depression or any other mental
health issues they may be dealing with in the current situation. This will be an augmented reality
(AR) app that will show positive messages while the person walks around and will have the option to
be used outside or inside. While they look around, the user will see images or quotes that will
reinforce them that life will get better you just have to keep taking one step at a time. As the
consumer hits milestones, they will receive incentives to redeem in the app.
  
<h4>Motivation</h4>
As a person who suffers from both anxiety and depression I have found it hard to find something
that helps me to stay motivated to keep exercising while dealing with mental health problems.
Psychology has always been very interesting to me, it was and still is something I want to pursue one
day. This app will be something that can help people who are feeling isolated within themselves. I
have been in that situation before and it’s not great, I found it very hard to leave that state of mind,
so this is what drives me to complete A Positive Walk to hopefully help both myself and anyone out
there who is feeling the same.
  
<h4>Description</h4>
A Positive Walk. This will allow the user to input things that they might be struggling with e.g. Anxiety, Depression, eating, waking up, smiling.
This will tailor the user experience to each person, making them feel like the centre of something. This will implement the idea that the person using this can build themselves up from the pit they may be feeling in. Walking around with this app open will track movement so when milestones are reached, they will receive medals and credits for items inside the app. The consumer can set goals to complete in a time limit/day limit, this could be a walking goal for 10km in a 7-day period or 10km walk in a month. From this they will get celebrated by the on-screen prompt with a huge congratulations and confetti. 
A Positive Walk will also have a community forum for people to share stories about how they did something that helped them to keep moving forward and take the next step. People can share anything about themselves, this could create friendships that will last a lifetime or even create walking groups if they are in the same area. Everyone wins in this app, for example, if you walk 1km even though you set a target of 10k it will praise you for completing part of it and not immediately remind you of the rest of the target you set.
Regular walking and getting exercise will help with releasing endorphins, dopamine, and serotonin. Your brain is something you need to keep working on, people go to the gym to gain muscle and strength, the brain works the same way but with brain cell growth. Exercising helps to motivate you in different way, with confidence and courage when the time calls for it. Even if it is a body image issue, exercise will help you lose weight or gain weight in areas you want. Seeing progress motivates everyone, without that we fall into pits of self-doubt, going backwards.
With AR (Augmented Reality) if the user doesn’t want to go for a walk or it is too late at night for a walk, they can open the ‘A Positive Walk’ app and move the phone/tablet around the room they are in and see different motivational statements or quotes from people in the community.                     This will also have links to websites for the user to learn more about the quote to have a greater understanding of what they read. They can also create their own quotes or messages and have the option to share them with the other users of the app, this could be friends or the community.
This will also have a page for the different hotlines for users, like HeadSpace or Beyond Blue as examples. This will include hotlines for all country’s that the app will be available in. A Positive Walk will be on both IOS and Android to reach as many people as possible.
Heart rate tracking through Apple watch or Samsung watch or FitBit, so the user can try and control it.
A website for people to update their targets, add stories to the forums (typing out a story on a phone can be difficult). 
An online diary for people to write down how their day was so they can look back on the entrees to see how much they have progressed; this also helps with getting things off your chest.


<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
I will need a greater understanding of both Android and IOS coding technologies and how to implement tracking movement, possibly watch connectivity for heart rate tracking. UI design to make the app look simple, easy to use, not a maze to find something. A feedback zone for people to help improve the app with different ideas.

<h4>Skills Required</h4>
The Skills I will need to have will be coding in a few different languages understanding how to have location tracking so the user can track walks/runs. How to add targets to someone’s calendar so they can have the reminds through-out the day or if the user is not near their phone, they can see what is coming up. Implementing a type of Notepad or Word document within the app so they can type out something.

<h4>Outcome</h4>
If the app is successful it will help a lot of people around the globe with dealing with their mental health and help with networking skills and communication skills that will help them in the world moving forward. If that is finding a job, just being able to communicate with a customer facing job. Making someone smile is something that personally makes me jump with joy on the inside, doing that on a larger scale would be unbelievable. The original problem wont be solved but will assist people in moving forward in life and creating a better person.
