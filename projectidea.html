<h4>Overview</h4>
A Positive Walk will be an app that assists people with Anxiety and Depression or anything they may be dealing with in the current situation they might find themselves in. This will be an AR app that will show positive messages while they walk around. This app will also have an option to be used inside and while they look around see images with quotes that will reinforce that life will get better you just have to keep taking one breath at a time. As the consumer hits milestones, they will receive incentives to redeem in the app.

<h4>Motivation</h4>
As a person who suffers from both Anxiety and Depressing. I found it hard to find something that helps with the mental problems and excising while staying motivated to keep it up. Psychology has always been very interesting to me it was and still is something I want to do one day. This app will be something that can help people who are feeling isolated within themselves. I have been in that situation before it’s not great and found it impossible to leave that state of mind, this is what drives me to complete for both myself and anyone out there who is feeling the same.

<h4>Description</h4>
A Positive Walk. This will allow the user to input things that they might be struggling with e.g. Anxiety, Depression, eating, waking up, smiling.
This will tailor the user experience to each person, making them feel like the centre of something because this will start the idea that the person using this will build themselves up from the pit, they may be feeling in. Walking around with this app open with track movement so when milestones are reached, they will receive medals and credits for things inside the app. The consumer can set goals to complete in a time limit/day limit, this could be a walking goal for 10k in a 7-day period or 10k walk in a month. From this they will get celebrated by the on-screen prompt with a huge congratulations and confetti.
A Positive Walk will also have a community forum for people to share stories about how they did something that helped them one day to keep moving forward and just taking the next breath. People can share anything about themselves, this could create friendships that will last a lifetime, create walking groups if they are in the same area. Everyone one wins in this app, walk 1k even thought you set a target of 10k, it will still praise you for completing part of it and not worry about the rest of the target you set.
With walking and getting exercise this will help with releasing Endorphins, Dopamine and Serotonin. Your brain is something we need to keep working on like how people go to the gym to gain muscle and strength, the brain works the same way but with brain cell growth. Exercising help motivates you in different way, like with confidence and courage when the time calls for it or even if it’s a body image issue exercise will help you lose weight or gain weight in areas you want. Seeing progress motivates everyone, without that we fall into pits of self-doubt, going backwards.
With AR (Augment Reality) if the user doesn’t want to go for a walk or its to late at night for a walk, they can turn AR on and move the phone/tablet around the room they are in and see different motivational statements or quotes from people in the community or famous people.                       This will also have links to different links for the user to read more about the quote to have a greater understanding of what they read. They can also create their own sayings and have the option to share them with the other users of the app, this could be friends or random people, or keep them for themselves.
This will also have a page for the different call centres for the users to if they need to talk to someone over the phone like HeadSpace or Beyond Blue as examples but for all country’s that the app will be available in. A Positive Walk will be on both IOS and Android to reach as many people as possible.
Heart rate tracking through Apple watch or Samsung watch or FitBit, so the user can try and control it.
A website for people to update their targets, add stories to the forums (typing out a story on a phone can be difficult).
An online diary for people to write down how their day was so they can look back on the entrees to see how much they have progressed; this also helps with getting things off your chest.

<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
I will need a greater understanding of both Android and IOS coding technologies and how to implement tracking movement whilst someone is moving, possibly watch connectivity for heart rate tracking. UI design to make the app look simple, easy to use, not a maze to find something. A feedback zone for people to help improve the app with different ideas.


<h4>Skills Required</h4>
The Skills I will need to have will be coding in a few different languages understanding how to have location tracking so the user can track walks/runs. How to add targets to someone’s calendar so they can have the reminds through-out the day or if the user is not near their phone, they can see what is coming up. Implementing a type of Notepad or Word document within the app so they can type out something.

<h4>Outcome</h4>
If the app is successful it will help a lot of people around the globe with dealing with their mental health and help with networking skills and communication skills that will help them in the world moving forward. If that is finding a job, just being able to communicate with a customer facing job. Making someone smile is something that personally makes me jump with joy on the inside, doing that on a larger scale would be unbelievable. The original problem wont be solved but will assist people in moving forward in life and creating a better person.
